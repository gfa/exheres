SUMMARY="A C++ logging library"
DESCRIPTION="RLog provides a flexible message logging facility for C++ programs and libraries. It is subscription based, meaning you can subscribe to messages of your choice in an number of ways: by hierarchical channel name (e.g. \"debug\", \"debug/ special\", \"error\", etc.), or filename, component name, etc. Log messages are individually enabled. It is meant to be fast enough to leave in production code - even where it may be called many times, as both the GCC and Intel compilers reduce the logging overhead a few clock cycles if they are dormant (with no subscribers). Other add-on components can extend subscriptions to external programs, allowing you to enable and collect debugging messages remotely.
